Exploring The Code
==================

1. The backend code lives in the `/assembly` folder. This code gets deployed to
   the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`. This sort of
   code-that-runs-on-a-blockchain is called a "smart contract" â€“ [learn more
   about NEAR smart contracts][smart contract docs].
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder.
   [/src/index.html](/src/index.html) is a great place to start exploring. Note
   that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you can learn how the frontend
   connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and backend. The
   backend code gets tested with the [asp] command for running the backend
   AssemblyScript tests, and [jest] for running frontend tests. You can run
   both of these at once with `yarn test`.

Both contract and client-side code will auto-reload as you change source files.
